It is hands down one of the most aromatic and flavourful biryani you could ever ask for. The long rice is heavily layered with golden fried onions, chillies, fiery chicken and mint leaves. A bite into it will leave you asking for more.

    <p> <a name="kalyani Biryani" target="_self"><h2> Kalyani Biryani</h2></a>Kalyani BiryaniAlso known as the 'other Hyderabadi Biryani' or 'poor man's biryani', Kalyani Biryani has an interesting history to tell. The Kalyani Nawabs of Bidar came to Hyderabad and set up their havelis there. They were known to serve Kalyani Biryani to people who visited Bidar. After their decline, the cooks then set up local stalls and served the biryani to the local population. It is a Mutton Biryani which is almost similar to Hyderabadi Biryani but has a distinct tomato, jeera and dhania flavour and may not be as rich as the Hyderabadi Biryani.

        This biryani makes a popular delicacy in the coastal regions of Karnataka. The rice and chicken are infused with spicy masalas giving it a distinct flavour. Unlike marinated chicken used in other biryanis, this dish does not need any marination or a base. Rather it contains generous amount of onions, tomatoes and spices. A delight for biryani lovers, this fiery dish is surely worth a try.

    <P>    <a name="beary Biryani"target="_self"><h2>Beary Biryani</h2></a>
        Beary Biryani or Manglorean-style biryani comes from the Muslim community in the coastal regions of Dakshin Kannada. Bearys (traders) are the people who live there. Beary Biryani has subtle flavours with the distinct aroma of fennel spreading through the grains. The dum biryani has spices that include nutmeg, mint leaves, fennel seeds, mace (javitri), poppy seeds, almonds, star anise and others. This biryani cooks slowly and tastes best on the next day of preparation.
